Version: 1.20.4

Hey all! This is my first plugin released to github but its not my first ever.

Meet the Weapons:

Abyssal Trident: Dual-functional trident that can do two main things. If it hits land, it will launch surrounding players (10x10 to be exact) up into the air but if it hits water (waterlogged block or water) it will pull players towards it. Cooldown: 5 Seconds
Chorus Pearl: Ender pearl but with a chorus-fruit infused core to make it randomly teleport you in a 20x20 area after it lands. No cooldown.
Echo Bow: A bow infused with echo shards that has a very special ability. If the first arrow hits an entity, it will soon follow with a tracking arrow slowly hunting down who you hit. Cooldown: 5 Seconds
Reflective Chestplate: A mirror-infused chestplate that has 4 charges before it releases a powerful blast back at the enemy for double the damage. Cooldown: 15 Seconds
Siren's Call: A mesmerizing song in a crystal that, when played, focuses all attention in a 30x30 area to where it was used. These who hear it can't move or jump or see for that matter as if they have tunnel vision. Cooldown: 30 Seconds
Transfer Sword: A sword that stores potion effects to release a powerful poison which its duration depends on the amount of stored potion effects. It can also suck up your enemie's potion effects. Cooldown: 10 Seconds

More to come!
